# My First C++ Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing my first-ever C++ projects from my time as a high schooler dual enrolling at Central Piedmont Community College! While these projects may be basic and straightforward, they mark the beginning of my journey as a programmer. I believe it's essential to showcase my progress and growth, and I want to make them publicly available on my profile.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and review the projects within this repository. Although they may not represent my current abilities or knowledge, they serve as a testament to my early efforts in programming. These projects are primarily intended for educational purposes and serve as a starting point for beginners in C++.


## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to my school and instructors for providing the foundation and guidance necessary for me to undertake these projects. Additionally, I appreciate the open-source community for their valuable resources and inspiration.
